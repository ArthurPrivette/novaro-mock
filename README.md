# Novaro

Novaro is an investing app that uses a swipe-based interface to help users discover and track stocks. Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, it delivers a modern, intuitive experience for managing a simulated portfolio. All transactions are simulated for demonstration purposes; no real trades are executed.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies using `npm install`.
2. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add your API key for live stock quotes:
   ``
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_finnhub_api_key_here
   ``
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev` and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

The app allows you to swipe through stock cards, invest with virtual funds, and track your portfolioâ€”all with a sleek dark/light mode toggle.
